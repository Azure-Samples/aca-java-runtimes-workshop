'''

Our microservices have several endpoints consuming memory or CPU.
Depending on the number of iterations and bites we pass as parameters to these endpoints, it can take significantly longer to respond.
We are going to explore the problem by looking at CPU and memory metrics.

== CPU

When you know CPU usage you are better prepared to answer the following questions:

* Is the amount of CPU resources maxed out?
* Have I over provisioned the amount of CPU resources?
* What does the baseline of usage looks like?
* Is there room to grow without scaling out or up?
* How much of the available CPU resources is it really using?
* What type of load is it?

== Memory

When you know memory usage you are better prepared to answer the following questions:

* Is the amount of memory used close to the maximum available memory?
* Have I over provisioned the amount of memory resources?
* What does the baseline of usage look like?
* Is there room to grow without scaling out or up?
* How much of the available memory resources is it really using?
