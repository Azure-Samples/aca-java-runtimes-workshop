= Welcome

This workshop offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session on Cloud performance.
From developing microservices written in Quarkus/SpringBoot/Micronaut, to packaging them in Docker containers, deploy them in Azure Container Apps and monitor the performances.

This workshop is a BYOL (_Bring Your Own Laptop_) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop.
You need JDK {jdk-version} on your machine, Apache Maven ({maven-version}), Docker, Azure CLI and other few tools.
On Mac and Windows, Docker for _x_ is recommended instead of the Docker toolbox setup.

What you are going to do:

* Create your own GitHub Repo based on a GitHub Template
* Develop one microservice that consumes CPU and memory with Quarkus, another one with SpringBoot and Micronaut
* Compile, package and containerize these microservices
* Create an Azure Container Apps environment
* Deploy your containers to Azure Container Apps
* Execute and monitor the microservices using different performance parameters
* Load test the microservices
* Improve thoughput thanks to scalability
* And much more!

Ready? Here we go!

=== How Does This Workshop Work?

You have this material in your hands, and you can now follow it step by step. The structure of this workshop is as follow :

1. _Installing all the needed tools_: in this section, you will install all the tools and code to be able to bundle, package and deploy our application.

2. _Setup Azure resources_: this section introduces Azure and the Container Apps service to prepare all the needed resources for our application. You will create an entire infrastructure on Azure (Container Registry, Postgres database, etc.) to make everything ready for deployment.

3. _Running the Applications Locally_: in this section, you will build Docker images out of our microservices, execute them locally with Docker compose, push them to Azure Registry, all that using Docker and Azure CLI.

4. _Setup CI/CD and deploy application_: in this section, you will setup a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions so that our application builds and deploy automatically on new commits.

5. _Monitoring_: in this section, you will add some load to your microservices, monitor them, scale them, check the logs, etc.

=== What Do You Have to Do?

This workshop should be as self-explanatory as possible. So your job is to follow the instructions by yourself, do what you are supposed to do, and do not hesitate to ask for any clarification or assistance; that's why the team is here.

Oh, and be ready to have some fun!

| A code editor, such as VS Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ | https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Get VS Code]

|===

If you have VS Code and Docker installed on your machine, the quickest way to set up your environment is to use the pre-configured https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers[dev container] of the template project. Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack[Remote Development extension] in VS Code, and skip to the next section.

TIP: You can learn more about dev containers in https://learn.microsoft.com/shows/beginners-series-to-dev-containers/[this video series].

You can test your installation by running the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
java -version
mvn --version
docker --version
az --version
